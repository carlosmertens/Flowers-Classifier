# Project: Flowers-Classifier
## Content: Deep Learning with PyTorch

### Project Overview
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. 
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

It is also required to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code

Template code was provided by Udacity, Inc. in the `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` notebook file. To run the project, it will also be required to use several Python files and the 102 Category Flower Dataset which was provided by Udacity Inc. Note that the code in `helper.py` and `classifier.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended to be manipulated. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.
While some code had already been implemented to get it started, it was needed to implement additional functionality to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `FLowers-Classifier/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

You can also export the Python files `predict.py` and `train.py` to be use in an App.
